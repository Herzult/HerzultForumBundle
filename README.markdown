HerzultForumBundle
==================

I simply forked the Forum bundle, as the development was going too slow and I needed some Subcategory features.
Also the Slug-Patch which is/was not going into the master tree leaved a sour taste for me.

Before reinventing the whole wheel I will start by using the edgy one and try to make it more round.

Side note: As I don't use mongodb I can't keep the Document Entities updated.
I will therefore add TODOs and implement Exceptions.

## Additional Dependencies

Some original Notes:

It's currently under *intensive* development.
